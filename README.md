# Exercise 1 (22/02/2024)
Exercise 1 (MPI OSU benchmarks) resides in folder `exercise1`. Job files (sh scripts) that were used on the ORFEO cluster to collect data have been gathered in the `jobs` folder. Analysis of the four collective algorithms (Broadcast Chain/Binary Tree and Barrier Linear/Double Ring) is carried out in the respective Jupyter notebook files. The creation of a Python environment is recommended and all dependencies can be installed with

```bash
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Results are stored in the `results` folder (exported graphs and final report in PDF format).
